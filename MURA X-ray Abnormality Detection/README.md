# MURA X-ray Abnormality Detection
MURA is a dataset of bone X-rays that allows to create models that find abnormalities.  Fastai v1 allows to create such a world-class model as part of the MURA competition, which evaluates the performance of a study classifier using the kappa score.

## What is MURA?
(source) MURA (MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs) is a large dataset of bone X-rays that allows to create models that determines whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal (we could use as well this dataset to classify bones into the categories shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger). [MURA](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/) is one of the largest public radiographic image datasets.
